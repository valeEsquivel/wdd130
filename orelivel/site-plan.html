         is equipped with. You can do all of this from the comfort of your home or wherever you are, finding an ideal place has never been so easy.

      <p>
        You want to enjoy an exquisite climate and a spectacular view of the Pacific Ocean, see magical sunsets, disconnect for a moment from the city, and enjoy a lodging equipped with everything you need.
        Here you can find different lodgings on beaches all over El Salvador, where we provide you the basic information such as time from the capital, prices, photos of each place, disponibility dates, if you can find a supermarket or a gas station near, and the equipment with what it counts. 
        <br /><br />
        On the other side, we have a catalog of cottages located in mountains, hills, lakes, and near the city with amazing weather; some of them have swimming pools, barbecues, camping area, and more. You can see here the equipment of each cottage, the distance from the capital, the number of people permitted, parking, and nearby establishments and restaurants. A perfect place to spend some time with your family and peers.

      <h3>FAQS</h3>
      <p>
        Are you one of those people who can't leave their pets when they go out, well, that's not a problem not to go and enjoy a beautiful day in one of the lodgings, some of them are able to receive pets (may have an additional cost) so you can enjoy next to the ones you love the most.
        <br /><br />
        Most accommodations have parking space for more than one car within their facilities, which helps you not to worry about something happening to your vehicle.
